# webfunction-cli

`wfn` is a command line tool for working with [webfunction](https://webfunction.org) packages.

It's designed to grow a small set of subcommands over time, each focused on
one task.

## Installation

Clone and build locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/webfunction-protocol/webfunction-cli.git
cd webfunction-cli
go build -o wfn .
```

## Usage

```sh
wfn                 # show general help
wfn help            # same as above
wfn help <command>  # show detailed help for a specific command
wfn <command> [arguments]
```

## Commands

| Command   | Description                                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `help`    | Show general help, or help for a specific command           |
| `codegen` | Generate a typed client for a webfunction package (targets: java, go, php, js, csharp, ruby, python; `--private` to include private endpoints, arguments, and attributes; `--file` to read the package from a local JSON file, though `--url` is still required; `--namespace` to set the namespace, package or module of the generated client); generics are expanded into concrete types |
| `convert` | Convert a webfunction package to another document format (targets: openapi, postman; `--url` or `--file` for the package; `--private` to include private endpoints, arguments, and attributes; generics are expanded into concrete types) |
| `validate` | Check a webfunction package's structure, flags, and generics usage, writing a report (formats: json, markdown, html; `--url` or `--file` for the package) |

More commands will be added over time.

## Where the package comes from

`convert` and `validate` take exactly one of:

- `--url <url>`: fetch the package from its package endpoint.
- `--file <path>`: read a local JSON file holding the same document the
  endpoint returns. Handy for testing and for packages that aren't deployed yet.

Giving both, or neither, is an error.

`codegen` always needs `--url`, because the generated client fetches the
package from that address at runtime. There, `--file` is optional and only
replaces the fetch at generation time, so you can generate a client for a live
URL from a local (possibly edited) package.

With `--file`, the status line reads `Loaded ... from file:///...` instead of
`Fetched ... from <url>`, and `validate` records that `file://` URL as the
report's `package_url`.

```sh
wfn convert --target openapi --file ./package.json -o openapi.json
wfn validate --file ./package.json -o report.html --format html
wfn codegen --target go --url https://example.com/pkg --file ./package.json -o client.go
```

### Namespace

`codegen --namespace <name>` sets the namespace, package or module the
generated client lives in. It defaults to `WebFunctionClient`. Each target maps
it onto its own convention, and `js` and `python` don't use it:

| Target   | `--namespace` becomes                                              | Example                                       |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `php`    | a PHP namespace: backslash-separated, each segment a valid identifier (otherwise `codegen` fails) | `Acme\Billing` gives `namespace Acme\Billing;` |
| `go`     | a Go package name: lowercased, punctuation removed                  | `Acme.Billing_API` gives `package acmebillingapi` |
| `java`   | a Java package: dot-separated, lowercased, punctuation removed      | `Acme.Billing_API` gives `package acme.billingapi;` |
| `csharp` | a C# namespace: dot-separated, each segment PascalCased             | `Acme.Billing_API` gives `namespace Acme.BillingApi;` |
| `ruby`   | the Ruby module name, used exactly as written (nest with `::`)      | `Acme::Billing` gives `module Acme::Billing` |

```sh
wfn codegen --target csharp --url https://example.com/pkg --namespace Acme.Billing -o Client.cs
```

## Generics

A package can define single-parameter generic objects: an object definition
that uses the bare type `T`, applied with a single-key object such as
`{ "object.list": "object.user" }`. `{ "array": "object.user" }` is an array of
a type, the same as `[["object.user"]]`. An application can appear anywhere a
type is expected, including inside object definitions. `T` is only in scope
inside the object definition that uses it, and a generic object must not apply
itself, directly or through other generic objects (see the
[generics spec](https://webfunction.org/generics)). Support in this tool:

- `validate` checks how generics are used: unapplied generics, malformed
  applications, `T` used outside an object definition, generic objects that
  apply themselves, name collisions, and so on.
- `convert` expands each application into a concrete type before converting.
  For OpenAPI, `{ "object.list": "object.user" }` becomes a `ListOfUser`
  component. Output for packages that don't use generics is unchanged.
- `codegen` expands generics the same way, for every target, so each
  application is generated as an ordinary type and the generic definition
  itself is not emitted. `{ "object.list": "object.user" }` becomes
  `ListOfUser` (in JavaScript, a `ListOfUserAttributes` typedef). Generated
  names join the pieces with `Of` and `Or`:
  - `{ "object.list": ["object.user", "null"] }` is `ListOfUserOrNull`
  - `{ "object.page": { "array": "object.user" } }` is `PageOfArrayOfUser`

  If a generated name clashes with an object you defined, the generated one
  gets a number (`ListOfUser2`) and `wfn validate` reports a
  `generic-name-collision`. Output for packages that don't use generics is
  unchanged.
- `convert` and `codegen` also print a `warning: generics: ...` line on stderr
  for each generics problem the validator finds, then carry on, resolving the
  problem to `any`. They never fail because of them; run `wfn validate` for
  the full report.

```

Each command implements a small `Command` interface (`Name`, `Summary`,
`Usage`, `Run`) and registers itself in an `init()` function. Adding a new
command means adding a new file under `cmd/` — no other files need to change.

## Testing

```sh
go test ./...
```

Each converter's output for every fixture package is pinned byte for byte by
golden files in `testdata/convert/golden/`. After an intended change to
converter output, regenerate them and review the diff:

```sh
go test ./openapiconvert ./postmanconvert -run TestGoldenOutput -update
```

See `testdata/convert/README.md` for details.
